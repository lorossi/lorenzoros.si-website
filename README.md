# lorenzoros.si-website
A repo contanining all the code used in my website

## Details
Everything in this website is client sided. This choice was made in order to save money by getting a simple web host instead of a VPS (I might reconsider this idea in the future).
The background colors and the "subtitles" (strings of text that appear under my name) are pre-generated using a python script that can be found inside the *python_scripts* folder.
I hid the email and my telegram links in the *email-hide.js* using my other project, [email-hide](https://github.com/lorossi/email-hide). I'm pretty confident this is enough to shield spammers.
